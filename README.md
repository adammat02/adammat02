## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am passionate about **embedded systems**, low-level programming, and robotics.  
My main programming languages are:

- 💻 C / C++
- 🐍 Python

I particularly enjoy designing and building complete systems — from hardware and electronics to firmware and high-level control software.

## 🤖 Engineering Project – 5-DOF Robotic Arm

As my Bachelor's thesis, I designed and built a **5 Degrees of Freedom Robotic Manipulator**.

The project includes:

- Custom PCB design  
- Low-level firmware (C/C++)  
- High-level control in Python  
- Forward and Inverse Kinematics  
- Modular hardware architecture
