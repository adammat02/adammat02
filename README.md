## About Me

I'm into embedded systems, low-level programming, and robotics. My main languages are **C/C++** for anything close to hardware and **Python** for higher-level control and prototyping.

I enjoy building complete systems — from PCB design and electronics, through firmware, up to control software.

## 🤖 Bachelor's Thesis — 5-DOF Robotic Arm

Designed and built a **5 Degrees of Freedom Robotic Manipulator** from scratch.

- Custom PCB design
- Low-level firmware in C/C++
- High-level control in Python
- Forward & Inverse Kinematics
- Modular hardware architecture

## Interests

In my free time I explore topics like artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning, and swarm intelligence algorithms (PSO, ACO). I like understanding how things work under the hood and implementing them from scratch.
